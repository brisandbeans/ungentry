*Code for Boston cares about innovation and technology.  It also cares about the ways it affects its surroundings.*

##Why are we doing this?

  1. We want to contribute to the policy discussion about cost of living and possible displacement.
  2. We want to get to know our communities better.
  3. We like playing with data and maps.
